# pytorch_mini_project

This repository is a collection of small PyTorch experiments created for learning and practice.
Each experiment focuses on understanding a specific concept such as data loading, model training, evaluation, and experimentation with neural networks using simple datasets.

1. [Rice Classification](rice_classification.ipynb) – It demonstrates a complete **binary classification pipeline using PyTorch** on tabular data, covering **data preprocessing, custom Dataset and DataLoader creation**, and **neural network modeling**.
It highlights hands-on usage of **model training loops, loss optimization (BCELoss + Adam), validation/testing workflows**, and **performance visualization** through accuracy and loss curves.t
